##
##  Basic Configuration
## ---------------------
##
## Run as a different username/groupname.
## This requires root permissions during startup.
##
server.username  = env.WWW_USER
server.groupname = env.WWW_USER

##
##  Tuning/Performance
## --------------------
##
## corresponding documentation:
## https://wiki.lighttpd.net/Docs_Performance
##
## As lighttpd is a single-threaded server, its main resource limit is
## the number of file descriptors, which is set to 1024 by default (on
## most systems).
##
## If you are running a high-traffic site you might want to increase this
## limit by setting server.max-fds.
##
## Changing this setting requires root permissions on startup. see
## server.username/server.groupname.
##
## By default lighttpd would not change the operation system default.
## But setting it to 16384 is a better default for busy servers.
##
## With SELinux enabled, this is denied by default and needs to be allowed
## by running the following once: setsebool -P httpd_setrlimit on
##
server.max-fds = env.LIGHTTPD_MAX_FDS
